# F1 Race Replay Roadmap

Since launching this project, I've receieved a lot of feedback and feature requests from the community. I thought it would be helpful for everyone (including myself) to have a clear vision and roadmap for the future of this project, so if you are planning on contributing or using it, you know what to expect.

## Vision

I want this project to be the hands-down best way for data-loving F1 fans to explore the wide variety of data generated during a race weekend. This means providing a rich, interactive experience that allows users to review races, laps, and sessions in a way that is both informative and engaging. Imagine your very own personal pitwall where you can analyze every detail of the race weekend.

## Primary Goals

- **GUI Menu System:** Implement a user-friendly graphical interface to navigate through the different race weekends, sessions and available formats for reviewing data.
- **Qualifying & Practice Sessions:** Extend replay support to include qualifying and practice sessions, allowing users to see how a session plays out from start to finish. (This is currently in development)
- **Lap Telemetry Analysis:** Use speed traces and other telemetry data to provide detailed lap analysis, helping users understand performance variations and strategies. (This is currently in development)
- **Comparison Tools:** Add features that allow users to compare different drivers' laps, strategies and performance metrics side-by-side (either during the replays or inside of the telemetry analysis).

## Your Contributions

If you would like to get involved with this project and help bring these features to life, please do feel free to reach out or submit a pull request. Your contributions are highly valued and will help shape the future of this project.

# Project Management

Full transparency, this is my first open-source project where I've accepted contributions from others. Usually I like to work on projects solo and then just release my code when it's done. However, the amount of interest and enthusiasm from the F1 community has been incredible, so I want to make sure that every Developer has the opportunity to help build something great here. I'll do my best to keep this roadmap updated as the project evolves so that everyone is on the same page.
